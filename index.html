					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>Weâ€™re buying the US Constitution.</p>
					<p>For the first time in thirty-three years, one of eleven surviving copies of the Official Edition from the
						Constitutional Convention will be publicly auctioned by Sotheby's. It is the only copy that is still owned by
						private collectors. The proceeds from the auction will be given to a charity that has been established by the
						current owner. We intend to put The Constitution in the hands of
						The People.</p>

					<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="question__q">What is your plan?</h3>
						<p>Immediately, to preserve and protect the Constitution. We intend to find a safe home for it, such as the
							Smithsonian.</p>
						<p>The ConstitutionDAO will govern future decisions around destination, preservation, as well as plans for
							purchasing other historical artifacts.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="question__q">Why is it a DAO?</h3>
						<p><strong>In short: so the people own it. Together.</strong></p>
						<p>Decentralization and cryptocurrency (Web3) has created structures that allow people to self-govern and
						fractionalize ownership with unparalleled levels of autonomy and freedom. Itâ€™s fitting that we use this technology
						to honor and protect the greatest historical tool for human governance: The US Constitution.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="question_q">Why the Constitution?</h3>
						<p>We believe that The US Constitution is a shared good and should be shared and displayed in public spaces â€” by
							the people whose governance and freedom it was created to protect. By purchasing it with a DAO, we distribute
							the responsibility among many, and provide the infrastructure to keep the Constitution preserved.</p>
