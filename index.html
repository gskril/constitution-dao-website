							<p><span style="font-size: clamp(1rem, 6vw, 6rem);">We the People</span><br> of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p>
							<p>All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist
								of a Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
							<p>The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several
								States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous
								Branch of the State Legislature.</p>
							<p>No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years
								a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be
								chosen.</p>
							<p>Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this
								Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free
								Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all
								other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of
								the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The
								Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one
								Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse
								three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey
								four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and
								Georgia three.</p>
							<p>When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of
								Election to fill such Vacancies.</p>
							<p>The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of
								Impeachment.</p>
							<p>The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature
								thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.</p>
							<p>Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as
								equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the
								Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third
								Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if
								Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the
								Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then
								fill such Vacancies.</p>
							<p>No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a
								Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he
								shall be chosen.</p>
							<p>The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they
								be equally divided.</p>
							<p>The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice
								President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.</p>
							<p>The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on
								Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And
								no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.</p>
							<p>Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to
								hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall
								nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.</p>
							<p>The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in
								each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such
								Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.</p>
							<p>The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in
								December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.</p>
							<p>Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority
								of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may
								be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each
								House may provide.</p>
							<p>Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with
								the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.</p>
							<p>Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such
								Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any
								question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.</p>
							<p>Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than
								three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.</p>
							<p>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law,
								and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach
								of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses,
								and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be
								questioned in any other Place.</p>
							<p>No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office
								under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have
								been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member
								of either House during his Continuance in Office.</p>
							<p>All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or
								concur with Amendments as on other Bills.</p>
							<p>Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law,
								be presented to the President of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall
								return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the
								Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds
								of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other
								House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall
								become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the
								Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House
								respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it
								shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the
								Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.</p>
							<p>Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be
								necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and
								before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed
								by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed
								in the Case of a Bill.</p>
							<p>The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and
								provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises
								shall be uniform throughout the United States;</p>
							<p>To borrow Money on the credit of the United States;</p>
							<p>To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;</p>
							<p>To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the
								United States;</p>
							<p>To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;
							</p>
							<p>To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States;</p>
							<p>To establish Post Offices and post Roads;</p>
							<p>To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the
								exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;</p>
							<p>To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of
								Nations;</p>
							<p>To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;
							</p>
							<p>To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two
								Years;</p>
							<p>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may
								be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the
								Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;</p>
							<p>To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square)
								as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of
								the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature
								of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and
								other needful Buildings;-And</p>
							<p>To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all
								other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or
								Officer thereof.</p>

					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>We’re buying the US Constitution.</p>
					<p>For the first time in thirty-three years, one of eleven surviving copies of the Official Edition from the
						Constitutional Convention will be publicly auctioned by Sotheby's. It is the only copy that is still owned by
						private collectors. The proceeds from the auction will be given to a charity that has been established by the
						current owner. We intend to put The Constitution in the hands of
						The People.</p>
					<a href="/constitution.html" class="background__link">📜  Read the constitution</a>

				<div class="content__section">
					<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="question__q">What is your plan?</h3>
						<p>Immediately, to preserve and protect the Constitution. We intend to find a safe home for it, such as the
							Smithsonian.</p>
						<p>The ConstitutionDAO will govern future decisions around destination, preservation, as well as plans for
							purchasing other historical artifacts.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="question__q">Why is it a DAO?</h3>
						<p><strong>In short: so the people own it. Together.</strong></p>
						<p>Decentralization and cryptocurrency (Web3) has created structures that allow people to self-govern and
						fractionalize ownership with unparalleled levels of autonomy and freedom. It’s fitting that we use this technology
						to honor and protect the greatest historical tool for human governance: The US Constitution.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h3 class="question_q">Why the Constitution?</h3>
						<p>We believe that The US Constitution is a shared good and should be shared and displayed in public spaces — by
							the people whose governance and freedom it was created to protect. By purchasing it with a DAO, we distribute
							the responsibility among many, and provide the infrastructure to keep the Constitution preserved.</p>
